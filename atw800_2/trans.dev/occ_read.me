Software Development in Occan using the Inmos Toolset
-----------------------------------------------------

- The Inmos Toolset is located below ATW_800\D72UNI.
  Wrapper to start the tools are loacted in ATW_800\MUPTOOLS. 
  For details how to use the toolset please read documentation 
  available online.

- Upon mupfel startup autmatically the needed environmet to
  call the tools is configured.
  You may test it be just typing "oc" at the mupfel prompt.
  This invokes the Occam compiler without any parameter and
  will output a usage page of the Compiler.

- Example:
  Goto VGADEMOS.OCC
  The Apfelmaennchen-Demo consists mainly of the following files:
  APFEL.OCC: The Occam Source of the Programm
  APFEL.PGM: The Occam Code that places the Procedures on the Tranputer(s)
  VGA*.*:    Those files are common files needed for the other Demos too.
             This is a server coded in Occam that handles the HW-Access
             to the ATW800/2. 
  MAKE.MUP:  The Makefile that calls all tools to create the executable
             named APFEL.BTL

  To run the executable on the transputer(s) make sure that
  the ATW is set to 1024x768x256 and type:
  
  irun APFEL

- Inside VGADEMOS.OCC are several small demo programs all with a Makefile:
  MAKE.MUP:  Creates Apfelmaennchen on a ATW800/2 with additional T800 in Slot 1
  MAKEF.MUP: Creates a fern leaf on a ATW800/2 with additional T800 in Slot 1
  MAKE3.MUP: Createa a 3D-Demo on a ATW800/2 with additional T800 in Slot 1

  MAKE_A.MUP: Creates Apfelmaennchen for a ATW800/2 standalone
  MAKE_F.MUP: Creates a fern leaf on a ATW800/2 standalone
  MAKE3.MUP:  Createa a 3D-Demo on a ATW800/2 standalone  

Text editors:
-------------

  me.ttp: MicroEmacs type me APFEL.OCC to open the soure file.

  origami: to invoke origami drop the file you want to use on the
           ORIGAMI.PRG in the VGADEMOS.OCC directory.
           If you want the real TDS3 feeling drop the file
           TOPLEVEL.TOP on ORIGAMI.PRG. Further detail on
           Origami and how folding editors work are available online.
